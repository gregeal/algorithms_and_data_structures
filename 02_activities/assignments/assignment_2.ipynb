This is accomplished using list slicing `nums[index + 1:]` which creates a sublist containing all elements after the current index.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time Complexity:** The current solution has O(n²) time complexity due to the nested iteration (outer loop + `in` operator). This could be optimized to O(n) by using a hash set to track seen elements:\n",

    "        seen.add(num)\n",
    "    return -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimized version has O(n) time complexity because set lookup is O(1) on average, and we only iterate through the list once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Complexity:** The list slicing creates unnecessary copies. The optimized solution above uses O(n) space for the set, but avoids creating multiple list slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explanation:** In the partner's explanation for Q4, they stated \"multiple tests have been performed\" but didn't explain the logic or reasoning behind why the solution works. A more detailed explanation of the algorithm would demonstrate deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative Solution:** The alternative solution proposed is creative but would actually be less efficient (O(n²) time and O(n) space) than the current implementation, and more complex to understand.\n",

    "My journey through Assignment 1 and this partner review assignment has significantly enhanced my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving. In Assignment 1, I learned to break down problems systematically and consider multiple approaches before coding. When I tackled Question 1 in this assignment (finding duplicates in a binary tree), I applied those lessons by first analyzing what \"closest to root\" meant, which led me to realize that level-order traversal (BFS) was essential, not just any traversal method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most valuable insight came from reviewing my partner Hemant's solution to the first duplicate problem. His implementation was correct but used an O(n²) approach with list slicing. This made me reflect on my own solution - while I used BFS with a set for O(n) time complexity, I realized that algorithmic efficiency matters greatly as data scales. Seeing a working but suboptimal solution helped me appreciate the importance of analyzing complexity from the start, not as an afterthought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code review process taught me to provide constructive feedback professionally. I had to balance acknowledging what worked well while suggesting improvements like using a hash set for O(1) lookups. This mirrors real-world software development where peer reviews improve code quality collaboratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, explaining someone else's code deepened my own understanding. I had to think through why their approach worked and where it could improve, which made me more critical of my own solutions. Moving forward, I'll always consider multiple approaches and optimize for both clarity and efficiency from the beginning."
