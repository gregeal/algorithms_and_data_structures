    "# bracket matching follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) pattern: the most recently \n",
    "# opened bracket must be closed first.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Here's how the algorithm works step by step:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. We use a dictionary (bracket_map) to associate each closing bracket with its \n",
    "#    corresponding opening bracket. This allows O(1) lookup for matching.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. We iterate through each character in the string:\n",
    "#    - If we encounter an OPENING bracket ( '(', '{', '[' ), we push it onto the stack.\n",
    "#      This \"remembers\" that we need to close this bracket later.\n",
    "#    \n",
    "#    - If we encounter a CLOSING bracket ( ')', '}', ']' ):\n",
    "#      a) First, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, there's no opening bracket \n",
    "#         to match with, so the string is invalid.\n",
    "#      b) Then, we check if the TOP of the stack matches the expected opening bracket.\n",
    "#         The top of the stack represents the most recent unmatched opening bracket,\n",
    "#         which must match the current closing bracket for proper nesting.\n",
    "#      c) If it matches, we pop the opening bracket from the stack (it's been matched).\n",
    "#      d) If it doesn't match, the brackets are incorrectly nested, so return False.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. After processing all characters, we check if the stack is empty:\n",
    "#    - Empty stack = all opening brackets were properly closed = VALID\n",
    "#    - Non-empty stack = some opening brackets were never closed = INVALID\n",

    "#    - \"()\" - adjacent matching parentheses\n",
    "#    - \"[]\" - adjacent matching square brackets\n",
    "#    - \"{}\" - adjacent matching curly braces\n",
    "# 3. If an iteration makes no replacements (string length unchanged), exit the loop\n",

    "#    - Empty = valid bracket sequence\n",
    "#    - Non-empty = invalid (some brackets couldn't be matched)\n",

    "#\n",
    "# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n²) in the worst case\n",
